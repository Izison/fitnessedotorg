{{{The RichNesse plugin is nice, but it can clobber some values. For
example intentional '----' that are escaped in a table get converted
to '===='. The need for '----' is due to my environment is not open
to change for me. Not sure that there is an ideal one, but if we
could find one, it would be nice for some users. The editor also
would need to be updated to take advantage of some of the changes
UncleBob mentioned to how SLIM handles html attributes in tables.
