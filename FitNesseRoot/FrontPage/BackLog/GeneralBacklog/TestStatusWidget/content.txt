{{{Way to indicate that a test is under development and is not final, but
can still be run. Possible options include:
* Final (implied pass - Green)
* Any other status = Exception
Currently implemented as a fixture, but a Widget makes more sense to
me. In my context we want to be able to evolve a test from an initial
state to a final one and want any test that isn't final to have at
least one failure in the test. So the Widget would potentially add to
the failure count for a test. 

I have currently made this work with a simple Fixture instead, but I
think a widget would be visually more appealing and consistent.}}}
