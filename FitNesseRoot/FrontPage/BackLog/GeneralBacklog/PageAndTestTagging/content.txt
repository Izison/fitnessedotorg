{{{When adding tests to suites for a new release it would be great if we
could easily search on tags so that developers can find tests and we
can keep tests organized by functionality rather than by story/new
feature. Not sure we need a tag cloud, but some sort of
search/exploration with test counts would be great. Maybe even a way
to find all tests that aren't tagged.
Could this be something that could be cached for performance?}}}
