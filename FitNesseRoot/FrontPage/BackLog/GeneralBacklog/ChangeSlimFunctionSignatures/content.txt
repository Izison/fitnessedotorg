{{{Fixture method syntax "setTitle[1]", "query[0] in error message. Why not use the same syntax as FitLibrary "setTitle(arg0)", "query()" or "myMethodWithLotsOfArgs(arg0, arg1, arg2)"? It would be easier for people that migrate from FitLibrary and follow the method/function call syntax of the most popular languages used nowadays. I pretty much sure that people are not going to know what func[4] means without reading the manual. However I would bet they will pretty much infer correctly what func(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3) means.}}}
