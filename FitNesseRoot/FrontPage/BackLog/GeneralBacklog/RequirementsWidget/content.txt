{{{Some sort of way to be able to identify pages based on the
requirements they cover and then be able to show a report of passing
requirements. If the requirement tags were then added to the XML
results, then a separate tool could parse that and extract the coverage.
* !requirement {REQ1}
Maybe this could even connect to an XML file that contains the list of
requirements and the descriptions and then replace with the
requirement number and text. I know this is probably more interesting
to folks where traditional requirements are done instead of Agile
development. I also know that some folks have been working on
something like this, but I haven't seen them posted where others can
access them.}}}
