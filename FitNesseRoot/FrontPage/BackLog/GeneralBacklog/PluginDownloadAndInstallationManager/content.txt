{{{Improve the way Fitnesse is distributed!!!
The single worst problem I had when starting out was to find a single
place to download all of the things I needed. The Hudson continuous
integration engine project (https://hudson.dev.java.net/) provides a
common area for all plugins (extra fixtures in the case of fitnesse)
in the same repository as the main distribution. Why can we not do
the same thing with Fitnesse. Organise the repository like so:

fitnesse-wiki
platform-runner (e.g. Java)
fixture-dbfit
fixture-webtest
fixture-genericfixture
platform-runner (e.g. .NET)
fixture-dbfit
fixture-webtest
fixture-domainfixture

Doing this would prevent duplication of work (see the WebTest v.
Fitnium discussion) because everyone would see each other's plugins
and it would make setting up the runner for newbies so much easier.
Gojko took a big step towards this with his fixture gallery but it can
go much farther. It's a great tool but the task of getting it set up
probably scares away possible users who don't want to invest a lot of
time in learning how to set it up, and that's a shame because it is a
great tool.}}}
