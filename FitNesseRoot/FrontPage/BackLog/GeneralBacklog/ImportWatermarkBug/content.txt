{{{we use the wiki import feature to have a different start page (with
local parameters) on each server (development, testing, customer
site,...) 

These start pages are locally defined and import the whole test set.

With the new version of FitNesse, also these local pages get the
Imported-watermark and, even worse, the respective buttons (Edit
remotely... which leads to a catastrophe...)

Looking at the properties of the page, there seems everything okay
(this pages imports its subpages from... NOT: this page imports its
content and its subpages...)

Going back to our latest version (20070619), everything works fine again.

Guess that's kind of a bug, isn't it?
Is there a workaround?}}}
