{{{I mentioned it to Uncle Bob already but java has had the notion of
converters since 1.1: they are called PropertyEditor. 
Yes they were invented with the bean framework and as such they could
be discarded as too gui centric. However they are not. They have been
built to do straight string<->object conversion.
The spring framework for example and all integrated extensions use
PropertyEditor to do conversion for their xml configuration.
There are a lot of already built PropertyEditors. 
PropertyEditors could not be simpler to register: by default if you
have a class like my.package.AirportCode, java will automatically look
at my.package.AirportCodeEditor. Obviously this may be too global but
there is nothing preventing SLIM from supporting contextual overrides:
some editors may need to be configured or changed based on the
context: I may want my time HH:MM instead of HH:MM AM/PM... Again this
is what spring does.}}}
