{{{Launches a javascript window or ajax window that prompts for a child
page name and then navigates to the new page w/o having to add the
page manually or edit the URL. I would even go so far as to say it
would be nice if it were an ajax dialog and asked for the following
information:
* PageName
* Suite checkbox
* Test checkbox
* Suite Tags edit field
The just the name option is easy and would be purely javascript and
css, being able to set the other values would be harder. Though could
be done by modifying the edit responder that creates a new page to
accept additional paremeters in the URL.}}}
