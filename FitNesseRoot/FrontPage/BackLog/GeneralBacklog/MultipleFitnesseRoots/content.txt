As a developer I want to be able to have more than one project in !-FitNese-! and yet put each project in it's own CM system so that I can have business people updating tests, but keep each project in its own CM system.

Strategy:  Allow multiple fitnesse roots.  Each root is searched in turn until a page is found.  This will allow projects to exist anwhere on the disk, and yet be brought into a single instance of FitNesse.
