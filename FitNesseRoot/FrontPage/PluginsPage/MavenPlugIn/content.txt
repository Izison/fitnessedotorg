!3 Background

[SNIPPED]
> Our FitNesse tests runs in a scripted environment (as part of a 
> continuous integration process). The build environment is Maven, and 
> makes heavy use of the excellent dependency handling that Maven 
> offers. The idea is that all jars, wars and ears that you are 
> dependent on are specified declaratively (using id and version 
> number), and fetched by Maven and placed into a "local repository".
[SNIPPED]

I'm not sure if anyone else is interested, or where to put it, but we have been fit/fitnesse users for quite a while and our latest project uses maven for the build environment.  We've got to the point where we need to have our customer test run nightly so we wrote a *very* simple maven plugin to call the fitnesse test runner ( both new and deprecated ).  I've attempted to attach the plugin to this message, but if there is a better place to put it, let me know.

!3 Usage

The usage is simple enough, the default for the properties are shown below and the page to test is also a property:

'''DEFAULTS'''

 * Where the output will go, default is:
maven.fitnesse.output=${maven.build.dir}/docs/fitnesse-reports

 * Put the results into a timestamped directory
maven.fitnesse.timestamp=false

 * Host name and port of fitnesse server
maven.fitnesse.host=localhost
maven.fitnesse.port=9099

$> maven -Dmaven.fitnesse.page=FrontPage.TestSuite fitnesse:test

or for the deprecated runner use the fitnesse:test-retro goal.
