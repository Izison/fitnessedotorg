|!c 4|Command-line test run|A command that takes a url to a !-FitNesse-! page, runs the tests located at that url, and exits with the number of failures.  It was agreed that the ''render'' stories was no longer appropriate.  This is the compromise.| Done |

|!c 10|Virtual Wiki|Users can create symbolic links on a local !-FitNesse-! to a subwiki on a remote !-FitNesse-!.  The sub wiki behave just as though it resided on the local !-FitNesse-!. <p>The rationale is that customer want to add fitnesse tests to the global server, but developers want to run the tests on their local machines.  Thus, the developers will symbolically link their local !-FitNesse-! to the subwikis that hold the fitnesse tests on the global server| Done ''Whew!''|

 * Opera 7+ clients need to be able to edit pages. '''done '''
 * SetUp and TearDown are pages very similar to PageHeader and PageFooter, but they only get applied to pages that have the Test attribute. '''done'''
 * We need a way to run many test pages at once, and collect the results in a summary page.  Also, all the result pages should be written in the TestResults page below the current page.  The TestResults page should have !contents, and should also contain the summary information.  Clicking on the runAll button should take you to the TestResults page. '''done'''

 * Allow pages to act as folders using dots between fitnesse.wiki words. Thus FolderOne.PageOne and FolderTwo.PageOne represent four distinct pages. FolderOne is a page that contains a sub page named PageOne.  FolderTwo is a page that contains a sub page named PageOne.  When in, or below, a folder, can either be global or relative.  Thus, if you are displaying FolderOne and you click on the PageOne link, it goes to FolderOne.PageOne. '''done I1 8 ho
