'''!-!img-! Tags'''
Changed the !-!img-! widget to allow relative URL specification in the correct form, such as /files/images/FitNesseLogoMedium.jpg

Fixed bug where a trailing '/' had to be added for a directory URL in the /files section.

'''Subpage Widget'''
A link to a subpage can now be specified with a preceding caret, like this: !-^MySubPage-!.

A fitnesse page can now be saved by pressing ALT+S.

You can now skip the automatic updating process that gets run whenever Fitnesse is started.  This is done with the '-o' option;
