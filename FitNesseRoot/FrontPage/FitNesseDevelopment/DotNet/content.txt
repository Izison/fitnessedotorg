'''IMPORTANT NOTE - the initial port of Fit to DotNet left a number of methods and properties exposed using the javaNamingConvention (CamelCase) while others use the !-CsharpNamingConvention-! (PascalCase). In the next release of DotNet FitNesse, ALL PUBLICLY EXPOSED PROPERTIES AND METHODS WILL USE THE CSHARP NAMING CONVENTION. This means that some existing fixtures will need to be changed to conform to this convention in order to upgrade.'''

The next release (September, 2004) will include a number of improvements to !-FitNesse.NET-!. For accurate documentation, look at the test suite under .FitNesse.DotNet (after the release), but here's an overview:

* Most importantly, all new features are unit tested and in many cases acceptance tested with FitNesse.
* Added support for .NET Properties
* Fields, properties and methods are all treated the same way. The new Accessor provides a simple interface to get and set values and hides the underlying member type from client code. This allows you, for example, to execute a method on your domain object, passing it a value based on the contents of a cell, all in one table cell.
* Fixed handling of Arrays
* Represent boolean values with true, yes, y, false, no, n
* Comment table for adding comments to a wiki page in tabular format.
* Graceful fixture naming/searching. A few tools have been added that allow you to write more friendly fixture names in table headers and fitnesse will still find your fixture.
 * Import table. Called "Import" for consistency with other versions of fitnesse, but is the equivalent of the "using" statement in C#. This allows you to type "!-SuperDeluxeFixture-!" instead of "!-SomeNamespace.SuperDeluxeFixture-!".
 * Graceful names for fixtues so you can type "super deluxe fixture" instead of "!-SuperDeluxeFixture-!".
 * Implicit search for fixtures ending with "Fixture" so you can type "super deluxe" instead of "super deluxe fixture"
* save and recall values in symbols using ">>mySymbol" and "<<mySymbol"
* keyword setter and expectation handlers for blank, null and error. If you want to explicitly set a value to empty string, use the keyword "blank". If you want it set to "null", use the keyword "null". You can also use these keywords to check a value coming back from the application. A query cell with "blank" will turn green if an empty string is returned. "null" will turn green if null is returned and "error" will turn green if an exception is thrown.
* syntax based !-CellHandler-! infrastructure (used for the aforementioned keywords) that allows you to easily add custom handlers
* Table Fixture grants you access to all the cells in a table and you can do virtually anything you want with them
