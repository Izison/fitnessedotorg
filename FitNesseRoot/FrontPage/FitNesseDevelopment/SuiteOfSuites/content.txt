!3 Suggested Story

I test multiple projects and would like to get a one Summary line per project. 

| !-abc.SuiteOfSuites-! |
| ProjABC |39 right, 1 wrong, 0 ignored, 0 exceptions |
| ProjXYZ |14 right, 0 wrong, 0 ignored, 0 exceptions |
| ProjPDQ |14 right, 0 wrong, 0 ignored, 0 exceptions |

Currently a parent-wiki runs all the tests of the sub-wiki, 
and reports them individually.
Could a parent-wiki show the summary table one line for 
each sub-wiki instead?
Is there maybe a way to do this with a new Fixture?
